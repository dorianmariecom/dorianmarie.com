Hello David, Jason, and everyone at 37signals,
\newline

My name is Dorian Mari√©, I'm a programmer since I started at 12 years old (now I'm 32 years old, so 20 happy years of programming).
\newline

Started with a bit of C, a lot of C++, years of PHP/SQL/HTML/CSS, then discovered Rails in 2020 (at 18 years old) and felt in love with Rails and Ruby.
\newline

I started rewriting a project I made in PHP in two weeks (a simple question / answer) and made it in one day with Ruby and Rails. I was impressed so I decided to rewrite my school's student's website in Rails.
\newline

In two weeks I made more progress than a team of 4 in 6 months doing it in PHP. So I trained the team in Ruby and Rails and we did it in Rails.
\newline

Having accumulated some experience with Ruby and Rails I found a 6 months internship in New York at Bespoke Post. That internship went well and we decided to keep working together.
\newline

After 2 years of working at Bespoke Post I decided to go back to school, then found an internship in San Francisco at Trusted for 6 months. Still in Ruby and Rails.
\newline

Then I worked at Doctolib, the biggest french healhcare startup, and thoughtbot that you know of.
\newline

Now I work at Workelo, an onboarding/crossboarding/offboarding company for employees of large companies.
\newline

But since I discovered 37signals, Basecamp, Hey, DHH, Jason Fried, and all the Basecamp culture I always dreamed of working at 37signals.
\newline

And I think now is a good time, I made my contributions to github.com/rails/rails and related gems
\newline

My personal project is a programming language named Code available at codedorian.com. I only have 7 users but it's making me happy to work on it in my spare time.
\newline

Hoping we get to get in touch and make great things together
\newline

Dorian
